Chocolate Ganache Recipe

Ingredients:
1 9 oz. your choice of chocolate
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Instructions:
1. If in bar form, cut the chocolate into chunks and place in a heat 
safe bowl. It doesn't have to be too small or evenly sized, just
relatively small pieces. If you have chocolate chips, or some other
form of chocolate that's in pieces, just place them in the bowl.
2. Heat cream in a saucepan to just barely boiling. Don't overboil or 
it'll come out of the pot!
3. Pour the cream over the chocolate.
4. Mix! (seems easier with a whisk, but you do you!)
5. Let it cool for a while before pouring over or coating anything with 
the ganache. It will thicken as it cools, so that it won't just slide 
off your cake.
